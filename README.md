A site for a local business that refurbishes and sells steel and plastic barrels.
=============================================
              Faith Drum Company

=============================================

Faith Drum Company is a family owned business run out of Humboldt, Tennessee that sells industrial sized containers to both large scale factories and organizations as well as the general public.

===========================================
      General Overview and Key Points
===========================================

The client wanted a site that accomplished two major things:
 	1. He wanted it to tell customers where the business is located. The shop is fairly far out into the country and people commonly have a difficult time locating it and often resort to calling him on his cell phone.
	2. He also wanted people to know what kind of barrels the company sold, and for how much. This is where the idea for the "Inventory" page came from.

The site was designed with simplicity in mind. This is because the people that buy barrels from this shop are typically elderly people who need barrels to burn their trash in. We don't like to generalize a group of people, but it may be more difficult to navigate a website for people of this age group. For this reason, we decided to try to appeal to the target audience by making the site as easy to navigate as possible, while still making it interesting to look at.

==================
      Header
==================

Our header consists of two pictures of a steel drum, the company name, as well as a breif subtitle.

==================
      Footer
==================

Our footer includes navigation (complete with a hover and select), the company address that when clicked, brings you to the location on google maps, as well as the phone number for the client.

================
      Home
================

The home page is meant to give the visitor of the site a general overview on what the business is about. We included a short introductory paragraph as well as a picture of the front of the shop. You will also find links to both the contact page and the FAQ page on the sidebar, along with a logo that we created.

=================
      About
=================

On the about page, you will find extensive information on how the business was founded, what the business does, as well as information about the people who run it.

=====================
      Inventory
=====================

The inventory page contains an HTML table with the various kinds of barrels that they carry, as well as the prices.

======================
      Contact Us      
======================

The Contact page contains a simple contact form with boxes for name, email, and message. The "mailto" address is currently set to Sam's Email, but if the site is ever launched, it will be changed to the clients.

====================
      Location
====================

The location page is primarily taken up by a large Google map with a small caption with some instructions on what kind of vehicles can accommodate a barrel

===============
      FAQ
===============

The Frequently Asked Questions page contains a variety of questions that the client is asked on a consistent basis. In the heading of this page, there is a link to the contact page. This is in case the customer does not see their question answered on the FAQ page.

==================
      Design
==================

COLOR SCHEME: We experimented with several different color schemes, but eventually landed on our final decision of dark red, gray, and white. We chose this color scheme because these colors contrast very well, but are still aesthetically pleasing when put together

FONT: We used the "Oswald" font consistently throughout the whole site because we thought that it looks rugged, while still maintaining a professional look.

LOGO: We decided to go with a very simple pop-art picture of a steel drum as a logo. We picked this image because it worked well with our color scheme in that it added another source of gray.

FAVICON: The main aspect of a favicon is that it needs to be scalable to a very small size and still be recognizable. For this, we chose a pop-art picture of a steel barrel. We found that it works very well with the theme of our site.

======================
      Responsive
======================

The site is mostly responsive on all devices. There were a couple of pages that we had some difficulty with as far as responsiveness goes, but nonetheless, all pages are fully functional with no features becoming unaccessable.

======================
      Conclusion
======================

We thank you for taking the time to look at our site! We hope you enjoyed judging it as much as we enjoyed creating it. We put lots of effort into making this site the best it can be. We could not have asked for a better opportunity!
