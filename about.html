      <h1 class="abouttitle">History of Faith Drum</h1>
      <p>
      Faith Drum Company was founded in 1976 by Wayne Kinzer of Humboldt, Tennessee after he had the opportunity to buy a small amount of chemical barrels from a factory that he was delivering freight to. He was quickly able to sell all of those barrels and was getting several orders. He had to gain several contacts in order to fulfil all of his obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
      Wayne quickly realized that a barrel is a very versatile and useful resource that virtually anybody can find a practical use for. He and his family have worked nearly every day since the companys establishment to keep the need for steel and plastic drums suppressed for both the general public and the various companies and organizations in the West Tennessee area.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Wayne is growing closer to retirement, as well as having undergone some health issues as of late, including a Quadruple heart valve bypass surgery in late 2014, most of the labor at Faith Drum Company is now taken care of by his son Richard, as well as his grandson Sam. Wayne still oversees many of the operations that take place at our shop. He also drives the Semi-Truck for pickups and deliveries.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of today, we acquire most of our barrels from various factories and organizations throughout the West Tennessee area. The majority of our inventory is either a low gauge steel drum that once contained automotive paint, or a higher gauge steel food-grade drum that used to contain cooking oil. Both of these drums are washed on the outside with a high-power pressure washer, while the food-grade drums have also been triple-rinsed on the inside with soap and hot water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith Drum Company has recently celebrated 40 years since being established in 1976. After all this time, we still pride ourselves in providing a wide variety of high quality industrial size containers to the West Tennessee area at a fair price.
